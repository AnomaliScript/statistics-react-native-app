# Hello! This is my first Expo App (or any mobile app, for that matter)

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This is an app that I've been wanting to create ever since I got a 5 in AP Statistics, and while I was studying for the exam in 2024, I wondered if there would be a more fun way to study for that exam (albeit easy).  So, I took inspiration from Elevate, one of the best "brain-training" apps in the mobile ecosystem, and now I'm planning to create an app that doesn something similar to that.
